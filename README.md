### What I learned

After following many courses (thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann) on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I finally decided to go on my own and build projects from scratch.

I learned a lot during this process.

I struggled quite a bit with setting up my project, downloading and configuring all the dependencies, and figuring out the right structure for my files.

After my first attemp I decided to redo the whole thing relying more on CSS Grid which made my life a lot easier.

Still I struggled with making the backgrounds of different section fit, figuring out how the clip path property and positiong the pseudo elements. In the end I am quite happy how this turned out.

My main weakness is organizing the code. Despite my efforts, I ended up with spaghetti code. This is something I need to improve in the future.

Overall, the project took longer than I expected. I found myself going back and forth on some properties and still struggle with justifying and aligning elements in Flexbox and CSS Grid.
